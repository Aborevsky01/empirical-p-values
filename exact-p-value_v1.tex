\section{Introduction}
The performance of machine learning methods, classifiers are typically evaluated with accuracy, ROC, and precision/recall metrics. However, in certain applications, such as those in biomedical area, False discovery rate (FDR) control is preferred. Several methods have been proposed to control FDR at a certain, user-controlled level. Perhaps, the most well-known FDR control method is the Benjamini-Hochberg protocol (BHP). Some FDR control methods rely on knock-off \todo{akf}{Check these knock off methods} or decoy samples. Perhaps, other types of FDR control methods rely on accurate p-values associated to each prediction.

\section{Methods}

It is important to keep it in mind that methods reporting p-values using either analytical models (such as normal distribution) or some empirical methods are just estimations/approximatinos of the true but unknow p-values. The question remains that how accurate the p-value estimation. If a p-value calculation method systematically produces more significant p-values, i.e. smaller numbers, than the true (but unknown) p-values, then it is called a liberal or optimistic; otherwise, if it systematically produces less significant p-values, i.e. larger numbers than the true p-values, it is called a conservative estimation. 

Luckily, there is a way to provide an estimation on the bias in p-values. It is known that, sampling from a distribution, the corresponding p-values are uniformly distributed. In order to show this, let us assume we are given a continuous, cumulative distribution function $F_X(X)$ and it is invertible, i.e. $F_X^{-1}$ exists. We want to show that, the p-values $Z = 1-F_X(X)$ are uniformly distributed, that is $F_Z(X)$ is uniformly distributed. Note that $Z\in [0,1]$. For the uniform distribution on $U\sim U_{[0,1]}$, we also have $1-U\sim U_{[0,1]}$ uniformly distributed, furthermore $P(U\le u)=u$ and $P(U>u) = 1-u$ for any $u\in[0,1]$. Thus,
\begin{equation}
	F_Z(u)=P(Z \le u) = P(1-F_X(X)\le u)= 1-P(X\le F_X^{-1}(u))=1-F_X(F_X^{-1}(u))=1-u.
\end{equation}

Therefore, one can plot a histogram of the p-values of the incorrect annotations in order to visually verify that the p-values are well calibrated. The plots in Figure \ref{fg:score_hist_pvals} show some visual verification of the p-values. 




Exact methods ... 
Let us discuss this method in detail. This method requires the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep-3pt  		
	\item Mass ...
	
	\item Exact methods employ ...
\end{enumerate}

The XPV method begins by placing a 1.0 to the $D[n,0]$, where $n$ indicates the discretized mass of the N-terminal group. This means that, there is exactly one N-terminal residue but its corresponding score is exactly 0, because N-terminal residues are not considered in the scoring. The elements of the dynamic programming table are filled recursively. Let us consider the cell $D[r,c]=n$, where there are exactly $n$ peptide fragments whose discretized mass is $c$ and they all score exactly $r$. Consequently, when all of these $n$ different peptide fragments are appended with an amino acid $X$, then there are $n$ peptides with a discretized mass of 
\begin{equation}
b=c+d_w(X)
\label{eq:new_column}
\end{equation}
 and their score

\section{Conclusions}
The original exact p-value (XPV) calculation methods for scoring tandem mass spectrometry data using a dot-product-like scoring function were introduced for low-resolution fragmentation settings almost 15 years ago. Until now, it has remained an open question whether this algorithm can be made suitable for high resolution fragmentation settings. In this article we showed a generalization of the XPV method, termed HR-XPV, which is capable of producing accurate and well calibrated exact p-values for XCorr scores obtained with scoring high resolution MS/MS data. Unfortunately, our solution can be considered rather slow, which raise questions about its practicality. However, we hope that, the ideas in HR-XPV presented might be a significant step toward the development of efficient methods for calibrating exact p-values for high resolution MS/MS data.
